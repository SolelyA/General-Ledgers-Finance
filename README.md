# Getting the Project Up and Running

To work on the project, you'll need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA. If you don't have one installed, download and install your preferred IDE.

Additionally, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have your IDE set up and Node.js/npm installed, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Extract Files**: Download the project files and extract them to a folder on your computer.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

npm install


3. **Start the Development Server**: After installing dependencies, run the following command in the terminal to start the web application on a local server:

npm start


This will launch the application in your default web browser.

4. **User Authentication**: Once the application is running, you'll be prompted to sign in or sign up. Use the provided authentication system to create an account or log in if you already have one.

5. **Explore the Application**: After signing in, you can explore and use the functionalities of the web application as needed.

By following these steps, you should have the project up and running locally on your machine.
